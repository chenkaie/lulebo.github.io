# MP4 Analyzer

Drop h264/avc MP4 or MOV files on the browser window to show a breakdown of the h264 stream. Presents the GOP structure and frame sizes in a nice canvasJS graph which you can zoom and pan in. New features will be added. Will choke on fragmentet MP4s or more advanced files. Will use the first h264 video track in the file. New in version 0.2 is the bitrate analysis. Bitrate is calculated per GOP and is presented in kbps.
